During these days, they usually do not hunt, but only drink water.  Gestation lasts about 110 days.  Litters comprise one to four cubs.\n Dominant males mate more frequently than their coalition partners.  During a study carried out between December 2012 and December 2016, three females were observed switching mating partners in favour of the dominant male.\n The average interval between births is 24 months, unless cubs die due to infanticide by adult males or because of diseases and injuries.  Cubs become independent at the age of about two years.  Subadult males leave their natal pride latest at the age of three years and become nomads until they establish their own territory."},{"text":"When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother.  They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.  Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs.  Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.\n Weaning occurs after six or seven months.  Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride.  They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.  When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die.  Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male.  Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs.  Up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two."},{"text":"For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire.  This behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminates competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population.  Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing."},{"text":"Infanticide is the killing of a non-adult animal by an adult of the same species.  Infanticide is often, but not always, accompanied by cannibalism.  It is often displayed in lions; a male lion encroaching on the territory of a rival pride will often kill any existing cubs fathered by other males; this brings the lionesses into heat more quickly, enabling the invading lion to sire his own young.  This is a good example of cannibalistic behavior in a genetic context."},{"text":"Daly and Wilson point out that infanticide is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world.  For example, when an immigrant male lion enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males.  Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in competition with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity.  In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to sexual receptivity in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a timelier manner.  These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"Lions kill their own cubs to eliminate competition for their own offspring and to cause the nursing females to come into heat faster, allowing them to sire their own young.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion"],"comments":["","","","",""]}]}

In a direct democracy, the citizens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on each issue. In a representative democracy the citizens elect representatives from among themselves. These representatives meet to form a governing body, such as a legislature. In a constitutional democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority, usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech, or freedom of association. \"Rule of the majority\" is sometimes referred to as democracy.  Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes."},{"text":"Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests is a 2010 book by urban designer, policy analyst and artist Michael E. Arth.  Arth attempts to expose what he calls the \"dirty secrets\" of America's electoral system, and provides a list of solutions that he believes will result in a \"truly representative democracy.\"  This democracy would be led by effective, trustworthy leaders, who would be elected by a majority, and who would not have to spend their time raising campaign funds, or catering to paid lobbyists."},{"text":"The second part of the book is dedicated to the invention of the representative model.  Shaped by forces as varied as the rebirth of towns, the rise (in northern Spain) of the first parliaments, and the conflicts unleashed by self-governing councils and religious dissent within the Christian Church, democracy came to be understood as representative democracy in this second phase.  Contrary to what other sources have often suggested, Keane points out that the oldest roots of that democratic model are in fact undemocratic.  The first parliament was not English, but Spanish.  Keane locates the birth of representative parliaments in the cloisters of San Isidoro Church, in León, Northern Spain - the site where King Alfonso IX convened the first cortes in 1188 CE.  Yet it took several centuries before the term representation began to be used in conjunction with democracy.  The birthplace of talk of 'representative democracy' – unknown to the Greeks - was late-eighteenth century France, England and the new American republic.  To find a common accepted definition of the word and of the actual meaning of representation (who was entitled to represent whom and what had to be done when representatives disregarded those whom they were supposed to represent ) was by no means an easy task to accomplish.  Much ink and blood was spilled.  The representative model of democracy as we know it is for Keane the result of many and different power conflicts, many of them bitterly fought in opposition to ruling groups, whether they were church hierarchies, landowners or imperial monarchies, often in the name of \"the people\".  The concept of the sovereign \"people\" was one of the most contested in this second phase.  The bitter controversies over who \"the people\" were, along with the common belief of the time that good government was government by representatives, characterised this era of representative democracy, an era which also saw the birth of an abundance of democracy-related neologisms, such as social democracy, liberal democracy and Christian democracy.  Often contrasted with monarchy, representative democracy was praised as a way of governing better by openly airing differences of opinion – not only among the represented themselves, but also between representatives and those whom they are supposed to represent while encouraging the rotation of leadership guided by merit."},{"text":"A persistent libertarian and monarchist critique of democracy is the claim that it encourages the elected representatives to change the law without necessity and in particular to pour forth a flood of new laws (as described in Herbert Spencer's \"The Man Versus The State\").  This is seen as pernicious in several ways.  New laws constrict the scope of what were previously private liberties.  Rapidly changing laws make it difficult for a willing non-specialist to remain law-abiding.  This may be an invitation for law-enforcement agencies to misuse power.  The claimed continual complication of the law may be contrary to a claimed simple and eternal natural law—although there is no consensus on what this natural law is, even among advocates.  Supporters of democracy point to the complex bureaucracy and regulations that has occurred in dictatorships, like many of the former communist states."},{"text":"Groups or individuals that describe Cuba is a “democracy” or claim that there is some level of democracy in the political system generally focus on community participation at local municipal level.

Similarly, Political scientists Haroldo Dilla Alfonso and Gerardo González Núñez study what they describe as Cuba’s “community power and grassroots democracy”.  They write that “this participatory system contained an interesting combination of direct democracy and the use of representation as granted by election. In general, it attempted to provide citizens with the ability to choose the local leadership, express claims, oversee and evaluate local policy and its results, and become involved in projects of community benefit.”  The pair concluded that “we ought to consider Municipal Assemblies as a remarkable step forward in building democracy”."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"A representative democracy is a system of government in which citizens elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a legislature, that makes decisions on their behalf.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion"],"comments":["","","","",""]}]}

However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin."},{"text":"As noradrenaline is an intermediate on the path to adrenaline, dopamine is on the path to noradrenaline (and hence adrenaline.) In 1957 dopamine was identified in the human brain by researcher Kathleen Montagu.  In 1958\/59 Arvid Carlsson and his group in the Pharmacology Department of the University of Lund, including the medical students Åke Bertler and Evald Rosengren, not only found dopamine in the brain, but also – like noradrenaline in Marthe Vogt's exemplary study – in uneven distribution, quite different from the distribution of noradrenaline.  This argued for a function beyond an intermediate.  The concentration was highest in the corpus striatum, which contained only traces of noradrenaline.  Carlsson's group had previously found that reserpine, which was known to cause a Parkinsonism syndrome, depleted dopamine (as well as noradrenaline and serotonin) from the brain.  They concluded that ″dopamine is concerned with the function of the corpus striatum and thus with the control of motor function″.  Thus for the first time the reserpine-induced Parkinsonism in laboratory animals and, by implication, Parkinson's disease in humans was related to depletion of striatal dopamine.  A year later Oleh Hornykiewicz, who had been introduced to dopamine by Blaschko and was carrying out a colour reaction on extracts of human corpus striatum in the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Vienna, saw the brain dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease ″with  own naked eye: Instead of the pink colour given by the comparatively high concentrations of dopamine in the control samples, the reaction vials containing the extracts of the Parkinson's disease striatum showed hardly a tinge of pink discoloration″."},{"text":"Dopaminergic neurons (dopamine-producing nerve cells) are comparatively few in number—a total of around 400,000 in the human brain—and their cell bodies are confined in groups to a few relatively small brain areas.

Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green.  Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis.  Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin.  The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.\n Animals typically use the color green as camouflage, blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment.  Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects.  Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment.  Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment.  For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light.  Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially.  Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet.  This can causes their feces to look green as well.

These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture although there are significant differences between the two traditions.  Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman Law, specifically a civil body of law entitled \"Corpus iuris civilis\".  This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Spain and subsequently being taught throughout continental European Universities.  Civil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems.  Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King's Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066.  The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions.  This common standard of law became known as \"Common Law\".  This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems.  In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an inquisitorial system.  In the common law system, most courts follow the adversarial system.  Procedural law governs the rules by which courts operate: civil procedure for private disputes (for example); and criminal procedure for violation of the criminal law.  In recent years international courts are being created to resolve matters not covered by the jurisdiction of national courts.

Bernoulli had planned on becoming the professor of Greek at Basel University upon returning but instead was able to take over as professor of mathematics, his older brother's former position.  As a student of Leibniz's calculus, Bernoulli sided with him in 1713 in the Leibniz–Newton debate over who deserved credit for the discovery of calculus.  Bernoulli defended Leibniz by showing that he had solved certain problems with his methods that Newton had failed to solve.  Bernoulli also promoted Descartes' vortex theory over Newton's theory of gravitation.

While it is clear that under the 12th Amendment the original constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to both the president and vice president, it is unclear whether someone who is ineligible to be elected president could be elected vice president.  Because of this apparent ambiguity, there may be a loophole in the 22nd Amendment whereby a two-term former-president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent's death, resignation, or removal from office (or even succeed to the presidency from some other stated office in the presidential line of succession)."},{"text":"The Twenty-second Amendment (Amendment XXII) to the United States Constitution sets a limit on the number of times an individual is eligible for election to the office of President of the United States, and also sets additional eligibility conditions for presidents who succeed to the unexpired terms of their predecessors."},{"text":"Since coming into force in 1951, the amendment has applied to six presidents who have been elected twice: Dwight D.

Around this time, Rynda and McHale began drafting artistic guidelines for the show, so that its animation style would always be somewhat consistent.

The UNHCR only provides refugees with legal protection, not physical protection.  However, local police or the legal system of the host countries may not take responsibility for crimes that occur within camps.  In many camps refugees create their own patrolling systems as police protection is insufficient.  Most camps are enclosed with barbed wire fences.  This is not only for the protection of the refugees, but also to prevent refugees from moving freely or interacting with local people."},{"text":"Climate refugees do not really fit into any of the legal definitions of a refugee.  Not all climate refugees migrate from their home country, on occasion they are just displaced within their country of origin.  Moreover, the refugees aren't leaving their homes because of fear they will be persecuted, or because of \"generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order.\"  Even though the definition of who is a refugee was expanded since its first international and legally binding definition in 1951 people who are forced to flee due to environmental change are still not offered the same legal protection as refugees."},{"text":"In contrast to economic migrants, who generally do not gain legal admission, refugees, as defined by international law, can gain legal status through a process of seeking and receiving asylum, either by being designated a refugee while abroad, or by physically entering the United States and requesting asylum status thereafter.

Refugees compose about one-tenth of the total annual immigration to the United States, though some large refugee populations are very prominent.  In the year 2014, the number of asylum seekers accepted into the U.S. was about 120,000.  This compared with about 31,000 in the UK and 13,500 in Canada.

The Commission's report, titled \"Personal Justice Denied,\" found little evidence of Japanese disloyalty at the time and concluded that the incarceration had been the product of racism.  It recommended that the government pay reparations to the internees.  In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which apologized for the internment on behalf of the U.S. government and authorized a payment of $20,000 () to each camp survivor.

The term \"enemy alien\" referred only to non-American citizens who were nationals of Axis countries.  Included in this number were thousands of resident aliens who were prohibited from applying for citizenship by race-based naturalization laws; when war was declared against their native countries, their status changed from \"resident\" to \"enemy\" alien.  Therefore, German American, Italian American and Japanese American permanent residents were classified as enemy aliens and interned as such.  In total 10,905 Italian Americans and approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned in many different camps and sites across the country.

The balls in the picture are views of horoball neighborhoods of the link.  By thickening the link in a standard way, the horoball neighborhoods of the link components are obtained.  Even though the boundary of a neighborhood is a torus, when viewed from inside the link complement, it looks like a sphere.  Each link component shows up as infinitely many spheres (of one color) as there are infinitely many light rays from the observer to the link component.  The fundamental parallelogram (which is indicated in the picture), tiles both vertically and horizontally and shows how to extend the pattern of spheres infinitely."},{"text":"The definition of a ray depends upon the notion of betweenness for points on a line.

If left to their own devices, soldiers might neglect to take off their own boots and socks to dry their feet each day, but if it were the responsibility of another, this became less likely.

They dominated the Prohibition era rackets all along the east coast, midwest and southern United States.  When Prohibition began, the Irish racketeers in New York City, Massachusetts and Chicago were still a dominant force in the underworld, especially in New York being that Tammany Hall and the city's political wards were controlled by a predominantly Irish group of politicians.  The Jewish gangs had always been a powerful force in the nation's underworld and were a very close second to the Irish in power, due to their numbers and business sense.  The Italian gangs were starting to assert their authority and influence in the underworld through their strong numbers and willingness to use violence.  During Prohibition there were two types of bootleggers: beer and alcohol manufacturers who operated breweries and distilleries and the importers who smuggled brand name liquor into the United States from Canada, Europe and the Caribbean by boat and plane.  At the start of Prohibition there were two big bosses who controlled beer breweries and all brand name liquor imports while the ethnic gangs controlled most of the home alcohol distilleries, some beer brewing and the distribution of most beer and liquor in the cities and towns.  Jewish crime boss Arnold Rothstein, along with Irish boss William \"Big Bill\" Dwyer, controlled the majority of high quality, brand name liquor smuggled in from Canada and Europe, all along the East coast from the areas of New York and New Jersey.  The liquor distribution was handled by their lieutenants and sold to the ethnic gangs that they did business with, who in turn supplied readily available customers such as speakeasies and blind pigs."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"The Prohibition Era in the US was from 1919 to 1933.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Other","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Direct paraphrase","Logical conclusion"],"comments":["The answer is derived from the passages and has no factual mistakes.","","The sentence summarises the information provided in the above passages.","","Logical conclusion from the passages."]}]}

Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions.  Schellhase also identified a \"coming of age\" element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover \"individual personality and strengths\".  Gabrielle Bellot of \"The Atlantic\" wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki \"shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman\".  In particular, Bellot cites \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\", praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä.

The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting.  On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company Studio Proteus was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation.  Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation.  Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for Newsweek and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as Analog Science Fiction and Fact and Amazing Stories.  Smith hired Tom Orzechowski for the lettering and retouching."},{"text":"Prior to creating \"Nausicaä\", Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, \"Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro\" (1979).  After working on an aborted adaptation of Richard Corben's \"Rowlf\" for TMS and the publishing firm Tokuma Shoten, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine \"Animage\", initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film.  \"Nausicaä\" was influenced by the Japanese folk tale \"The Princess who Loved Insects\", a similarly-named character from Homer's \"Odyssey\", the Minamata Bay mercury pollution, and various works of science fiction and fantasy by Western writers, among other sources.  The manga was serialized intermittently in \"Animage\" from 1982 to 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven \"tankōbon\" volumes.

Dani Cavallaro also suggests inspiration from \"The Princess Who Loved Insects\" folktale, and the works of William Golding.  Nausicaä, the character, was inspired in name and personality, by Homer's Phaeacian princess in the \"Odyssey\".  While a connection to Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" is often made there is no confirmation apart from the name \"Ohmu\" being a syllabic rendition of the English \"worm\".  Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the polluted world of \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\".

{"query_id":53,"query":"When does Menopause start?","context":[{"text":"Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children.  Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age.  Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year.  It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries.  In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be viewed to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell.  Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.\n In the years before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow.  During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin.  Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two.  Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes.  The severity of symptoms varies between women.  While menopause is often thought to be linked to an increase in heart disease, this primarily occurs due to increasing age and does not have a direct relationship with menopause.  In some women, problems that were present like endometriosis or painful periods will improve after menopause.\n Menopause is usually a natural change.  It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco.  Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries or some types of chemotherapy.  At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone.  While typically not needed, a diagnosis of menopause can be confirmed by measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine.  Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when a girl's periods start.\n Specific treatment is not usually needed.  Some symptoms, however, may be improved with treatment.  With respect to hot flashes, avoiding smoking, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended.  Sleeping in a cool room and using a fan may help.  The following medications may help: menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), clonidine, gabapentin, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Exercise may help with sleeping problems.  While MHT was once routinely prescribed, it is now only recommended in those with significant symptoms, as there are concerns about side effects.

Thus, a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted.

Hepatitis C is a contagious disease that primarily affects the liver, causing severe damage as the disease progresses.  It is caused by the Hepatitis C virus, a small, enveloped RNA virus.  The transmission of hepatitis C is through the contact with the blood of the infected person,for example by sharing the needles or by using non-sterile medical equipment.  HCV is transmitted globally because of the high infection rate and is also associated with a high mortality rate.  The World Health Organisation indicates the 3.3% of the world population is infected by the HCV virus.  Statistical records show that there are about 13 million HCV affected persons in china, 3.5 million affected persons in the United States, and about 10 million people are affected by HCV in Pakistan.  In all cases, the viral genotype of the HCV stays the same, occasionally mutations do occur making the treatment more complex by targeting the changes in the genotype.  Hepatitis C virus genotype is considered more common than the Hepatitis B virus infection contributing to more than a million cases annually and is considered one of the major reason for liver transplantation in United States.

With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952.  Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection.  Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler."},{"text":"Glock pistols are designed with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge.  The system, designated \"Safe Action\" by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety.  The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger.  Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector.  The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis).  It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar.  The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger.  The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released.  This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs.  The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments."},{"text":"In 1991, the station developed First Alert, the first automated weather warning system for television use (which was based on the manual-input First Warning system developed by KWTV around that time); it also assembled crews of storm chasing units, the \"First Alert Storm Teams\" (or \"F.A.S.T. units\"), which utilized custom vehicles equipped with video cameras and pioneering technology that enabled still photographs to be transmitted over cellular telephone (the \"First Pix\" cell technology as well as \"First Alert\" would earn the station a Regional News Emmy Award in 1991).

Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended.  A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth.  However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too.  With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.  Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants.  There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed.  For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily.  They just wear what they would normally wear.  Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants."},{"text":"The value of collected data completely depends upon how truthful respondents are in their answers on questionnaires.  In general, survey researchers accept respondents’ answers as true.  Survey researchers avoid reactive measurement by examining the accuracy of verbal reports, and directly observing respondents’ behavior in comparison with their verbal reports to determine what behaviors they really engage in or what attitudes they really uphold.  Studies examining the association between self reports (attitudes, intentions) and actual behavior show that the link between them—though positive—is not always strong—thus caution is needed when extrapolating self-reports to actual behaviors, Dishonesty is pronounced in some sex-related queries, with men often amplifying their number of sex partners, while women tend to downplay and slash their true number."},{"text":"A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically.

Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher.  That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling)."},{"text":"Survey research is often used to assess thoughts, opinions, and feelings.

Psychologists and sociologists often use surveys to analyze behavior, while it is also used to meet the more pragmatic needs of the media, such as, in evaluating political candidates, public health officials, professional organizations, and advertising and marketing directors.  A survey consists of a predetermined set of questions that is given to a sample.  With a representative sample, that is, one that is representative of the larger population of interest, one can describe the attitudes of the population from which the sample was drawn.  Further, one can compare the attitudes of different populations as well as look for changes in attitudes over time.

The political corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure had become a major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s.  In response Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign.  Andropov believed that the Soviet economy would possibly recover if the Soviet Government was able to increase social discipline amongst workers.  Brezhnev's regime was also criticised for ideological laxness and self-indulgence.  The gerontocracy established by Brezhnev was slowly phased out by Andropov, and new recruits were appointed to the Party \"centre\", such as future Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Chief Ideologue Yegor Ligachev.  Soviet foreign policy had also gone awry during Brezhnev's last years, and by June 1982, just before his death, Ronald Reagan classified the Soviet Union as an \"Evil Empire\".  This hardline diplomatic stance did not wither away before Mikhail Gorbachev initiated the \"New Thinking\".  Support for Marxism–Leninism continued to be evident amongst the Soviet people, however, its base of support slowly withered during the Brezhnev Era.  The Soviet people still remained wary of such concepts as liberal democracy and multi-party systems, and because of it, Marxism–Leninism remained the leading belief in the country.

Rome considered that Segeda was breaking the treaty.  It forbade the building of the wall, demanded the tribute and the provision of a contingent for the Roman army in accordance with the stipulations of Gracchus' treaty.  The Segedans replied that the treaty forbade the construction of new towns, but did not forbid the fortification existing ones.  They also said that they had been subsequently released from the tribute and the military contingent by the Romans.  This was true, but the senate argued that when it granted such exemptions it always specified that they were to continue only during its pleasure.

At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his \"David\", was designated the opposite wall.  This was the only time that Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo worked together on the same project.  The painting of Michelangelo depicted an episode from the Battle of Cascina, when a group of bathing soldiers was surprised by the enemy.  However Michelangelo did not stay in Florence long enough to complete the project.  He was able to finish his cartoon, but only began the painting.  He was invited back to Rome in 1505 by the newly appointed Pope Julius II and was commissioned to build the Pope's tomb."},{"text":"The Florentine \"Prigioni\" (The \"Young Slave\", the \"Bearded Slave\", the \"Atlas Slave\", and the \"Awakening Slave\") were probably sculpted in the latter half of the 1520s, when Michelangelo was employed at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians have suggested dates between 1519 and 1534).  They are known to have been in the artist's store on the via Mozza until 1544, when Michelangelo's nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti, asked for permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not set foot in Florence after 1534).  This permission was denied and it was only in 1564 that they were sold, along with \"The Genius of Victory\" to the Grand Duke Cosimo I, who placed them in the four corners of the Grotto of Buontalenti before 1591.  They were removed from there in 1908 to join the Michelangelo collection which had been formed in the Florentine gallery."},{"text":"When Cosimo came into possession of the collection containing the most important statues of Michelangelo (the Bacchus or the Genius of Victory), the \"Apollo-David\" was placed in the Boboli Gardens, where it decorated a long niche of its amphitheater.  In 1824 the statue was transported to the Uffizi, and later placed into the collection at the Bargello.  Now it is in the National Gallery of Art Museum, part of the Renaissance wing complete with European paintings and sculptures."},{"text":"It is possible that the \"David\" was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it.  Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there.  Donatello's bronze \"David,\" made for the Medici family, perhaps 1440, had been appropriated by the Signoria in 1494, when the Medici were exiled from Florence, and the statue was installed in the courtyard of the Palazzo della Signoria, where it stood for the Republican government of the city.  By placing Michelangelo's statue in the same general location, the Florentine authorities ensured that \"David\" would be seen as a political parallel as well as an artistic response to that earlier work.  These political overtones led to the statue being attacked twice in its early days.  Protesters pelted it with stones the year it debuted, and, in 1527, an anti-Medici riot resulted in its left arm being broken into three pieces."},{"text":"With the completion of the \"David\" came another commission.

This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface.  Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in waterproofed leather, it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden screw thread adjustable plungers pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft.  The sketch (left) suggests that the depth adjustment was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface.  There is no obvious accommodation for crew.  The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius.  Its fate was to become buried in mud.  In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his \"Secret Inventions\" the following: \"These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform.\"\n It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans.  Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Van Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620.

He used helia in many inventions, including back-packs that could help a man float in the air or fly upwards, and in the remarkable titular submarine that could, when enough helia was used, fly!

Originally launched in 1864 as a human-powered vessel, propelled by 16 men, it was converted to peroxide propulsion and steam in 1867.  The craft was designed for a crew of two, could dive to , and demonstrated dives of two hours.  On the surface, it ran on a steam engine, but underwater such an engine would quickly consume the submarine's oxygen.  To solve this problem, Monturiol invented an air-independent propulsion system.  As the air-independent power system drove the screw, the chemical process driving it also released oxygen into the hull for the crew and an auxiliary steam engine.  Apart from being mechanically powered, Monturiol's pioneering double hulled vessels also solved pressure, buoyancy, stability, diving and ascending problems that had bedeviled earlier designs."},{"text":"Dolphin invented the 'Welman', a one-man submarine that was prototyped at Station IX.

It was decided to try the Welman submarine in an attack on the Floating Dock in Bergen harbour so on 20 November 1943 MTB635 and MTB625 left Lunna Voe, Shetland, carrying Welmans W45 (Lt. C. Johnsen, Royal Norwegian Navy), W46 (Lt B. Pedersen, Norwegian Army), W47 (Lt. B. Marris, RNVR) and W48 (Lt. J. Holmes, RN).  The craft were launched at the entrance to the fjord.  Pedersen's W46 became entangled in an anti-submarine net and had to surface, where she was captured by a German patrol craft.  Pedersen survived the war in a prison camp and the other three eventually had to be scuttled.  Their operators made their way north with the help of Norwegian resistance members and were picked up in February 1944 by MTB653.  The failure made the Royal Navy concentrate on X craft and XE craft, although further Welman trials took place in Australia."},{"text":"The success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the torpedo, invented by Robert Whitehead in 1866.  His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago.  Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war.  Until the perfection of the guided torpedo, multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target.  With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited.  To increase combat endurance most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their deck guns against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships.  The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French and the Royal Navy's and M-class submarines.  With the arrival of Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack.  A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\n The ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers.  Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose.  Modern submarine-laid mines, such as the British Mark 5 Stonefish and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"The invention of the submarine cannot be attributed to a single individual, as various designs and prototypes were created by different inventors over time.

{"query_id":70,"query":"When did the American Renaissance happen?","context":[{"text":"Many argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337).  Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won).  Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance.  Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did.  Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins."},{"text":"The first stage of the Harlem Renaissance started in the late 1910s.  In 1917, the premiere of \"Three Plays for a Negro Theatre\" took place.  These plays, written by white playwright Ridgely Torrence, featured African-American actors conveying complex human emotions and yearnings.  They rejected the stereotypes of the blackface and minstrel show traditions.  James Weldon Johnson in 1917 called the premieres of these plays \"the most important single event in the entire history of the Negro in the American Theater\".  Another landmark came in 1919, when the poet Claude McKay published his militant sonnet, \"If We Must Die\", which introduced a dramatically political dimension to the themes of African cultural inheritance and modern urban experience featured in his 1917 poems \"Invocation\" and \"Harlem Dancer\" (published under the pseudonym Eli Edwards, these were his first appearance in print in the United States after immigrating from Jamaica).  Although \"If We Must Die\" never alluded to race, African-American readers heard its note of defiance in the face of racism and the nationwide race riots and lynchings then taking place.  By the end of the First World War, the fiction of James Weldon Johnson and the poetry of Claude McKay were describing the reality of contemporary African-American life in America."},{"text":"The American Renaissance period in American literature ran from about 1830 to around the Civil War.

Different organizations give advice on how to build bucket toilets in case of emergency.  The Twin Bucket Emergency Toilet system (a two bucket system), for example, has been developed in Christchurch, New Zealand following their infrastructure destroying earthquake in 2011.  The system has been endorsed by the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management.  It is promoted by the volunteer advocacy group PHLUSH (Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human) for reasons of safety, affordability, and matching ecological sanitation principles."},{"text":"Pit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as dry toilets, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia.  However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied, without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but dried feces (in the case of urine-diverting dry toilets) or compost (in the case of composting toilets), for example.  In the case of Arborloo toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse\/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole."},{"text":"Many of these UDDTs serve indigenous communities who live along small rivers as well as ecotourism operations in the Amazonian part of the country.  In these regions, piped water supply is often lacking, clay-rich soils do not permit infiltration of wastewater, and the groundwater level is usually high.  These factors make other types of toilets or other forms of excreta management problematic.  For example, local governments and ecotourism operations often install flush toilets that drain straight into rivers or into holes in the ground, where the water is intended to drain but cannot, since the soil is mostly impermeable clay.  Coupled with the abundant local rainfall, these pits tend to fill very fast and overflow into the nearest streams.  The streams get easily contaminated with fecal matter, as they are often quite small and there is not much dilution with clean river water.  This leads to health hazards for the communities who use these rivers for drinking water, washing, swimming, and fishing."},{"text":"In a pour-flush pit latrine, a squatting or pedestal toilet with a water seal (U-trap or siphon) is used over one or two offset pits.  Therefore, these types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise have many of the same characteristics as simple pit latrines.  About one to three liters of water is used per flush in that case, and they often have two pits that are used one after the other (\"twin pit pour flush pit latrine\").  For this reason they are subsumed under the term \"pit latrine\".  The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines.  However, significant health risks for the workers who are emptying the pits remain in either case.\n An alternative to U-trap or siphon designs is to incorporate a counter-weighted trap door mechanism that provides an air-tight water seal in the closed position.  Addition of a small amount of water (generally less than 500 ml) overcomes the counterweight and allows the fecal matter to enter the pit.  The devices are sold under the name of \"SaTo pan\" for as little as US$1.85, and more than 800,000 of them have been installed worldwide since introduction in 2013."},{"text":"A pit latrine, also known as pit toilet or long drop, is a type of toilet that collects human feces in a hole in the ground.  Urine and feces enter the pit through a drop hole in the floor, which might be connected to a toilet seat or squatting pan for user comfort.  Pit latrines can be built to function without water (dry toilet) or they can have a water seal (pour-flush pit latrine).  When properly built and maintained, pit latrines can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation.  This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies.  These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections.  Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days.  Pit latrines are a low cost method of separating feces from people.\n A pit latrine generally consists of three major parts: a hole in the ground, a concrete slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter.  The shelter is also called an outhouse.  The pit is typically at least three meters (10 feet) deep and one meter (3.2 feet) across.  The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in.  Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies.  This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use.  The World Health Organization recommends the pits are built a reasonable distance from the house, balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell.  The distance from water wells and surface water should be at least 10 meters (32 feet) to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution.  When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location.  Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge.  If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.\n A basic pit latrine can be improved in a number of ways.  One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure.  This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet.  It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass).  In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor.  Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of the upper part of the pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.  In developing countries the cost of a simple pit toilet is typically between US$25 and $60.  Recurring expenditure costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine, and up to three times higher for a pour flush pit latrine (without the costs of emptying). \n As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people, mostly in developing countries.  About 892 million people (12 percent of the global population), practiced open defecation in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets.  Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to toilets.  The Indian government has been running a campaign called \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\" (Clean India Mission in English) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation by convincing people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines.  It is estimated that 85 million pit latrines have been built due to that campaign as of 2018.  Another example from India is the \"No Toilet, No Bride\" campaign which promotes toilet uptake by encouraging women to refuse to marry men who do not own a toilet."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"Pit toilets, also known as pit latrines, work by collecting human feces in a hole dug in the ground.

The very first pattern was for the Porsche 356.  The first order for the protective covers for the cars’ front fascia (a.k.a. ‘car bras’) was for 12 units.  After that, he was asked to make 150.  Yet, after the second order was given to the buyers, he stopped making car bras, in order to concentrate on the main business.  And only by the mid-1970’s he realized that this business took over upholstery, and he concentrated on car bras production, having given this name to his invention.  The pattern Colgan designed was the creation of the one-piece \"Original Car Bra.\"  The word 'bra' came from the woman's breast-support undergarment, the brassiere."},{"text":"In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878.

He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883).  Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability.  They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design.  Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.  Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany.

Each NFL team is required to schedule four preseason games, two of which must be at its home stadium, but the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any teams playing in an American Bowl game, play five preseason games.  Preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals.  Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut.  The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games, as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season."},{"text":"In its early years after , the NFL did not have a set schedule, and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games, many against independent professional, college, or amateur teams.  From through , they played from eleven to fourteen games per season, depending on the number of teams in the league.  From through , each NFL team played 12 games per season.  The American Football League began play in 1960 and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen-week season, in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice, with one bye week.  Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen-game schedule in ."},{"text":"Teams do not play a given conference opponent from outside their division more than once during the regular season.  However, they may meet again for a second time in the playoffs.  The NFL schedules divisions to play against each other on a rotating basis, so that every team from one division will play every team from another division, for a total of four games per team.  Each team will also play one team from each of the remaining two divisions within the conference that finished in the same divisional standing position in the prior year—for a grand total of 20 conference games.  Conference games are often important, as a team's record in common games, as well as its overall record against its conference, is sometimes used as a tiebreaker for playoff seeding at the end of the regular season.  Also, many regular season opponents have met again in the playoffs, and the result of a regular season game can affect where the playoff game will be played.  Conference rivals will play each other at least once every three years in the regular season, and as frequently as once every year depending on record, and can play each other in the preseason."},{"text":"Purely geographic rivalries are rare in the NFL, since crosstown rivals do not play each other nearly as often as in other leagues that have more games (and therefore more opportunities to play other teams).  For example, Major League Baseball teams face each league opponent at least six times in the regular season, and within a division as many as 19 times.  In recent years, the NFL changed its scheduling formula to ensure every possible matchup happens within a four-year span, not counting pre-season games or the Super Bowl.  A main factor in the fact that crosstown rivals are almost always in opposing conferences is history: in the three current markets (New York\/New Jersey, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay Area) that have two NFL teams, all have one team (Jets in New York, Raiders in Oakland, Chargers in Los Angeles) that was a member of the American Football League.  As part of the AFL–NFL merger, all AFL teams had to be retained, even if it meant multiple teams in one metropolitan area.  The newly merged league opted not to go through an extensive geographical realignment, and instead, the AFL formed the basis of the AFC, and the old NFL formed the basis of the NFC; as a result, each team ended up in an opposite conference from their crosstown rival.  This allowed the combined league to retain both existing television partnerships of each league—NBC for the AFL\/AFC, and CBS for the NFL\/NFC—instead of choosing one or the other (ABC joined the mix in 1970 with \"Monday Night Football\")."},{"text":"There have been proposals to expand the regular season schedule to 17 or 18 games per team.

However, a longer regular season proposal was defeated in the 2011 labor negotiations between the owners and the players association.  One of the proposals for the 17th and 18th games is to have every team play at least one game abroad every year.  Another idea being put forth by Houston Texans owner Bob McNair is to move the traditional regional rivalries that are currently played in the preseason (such as the Governor's Cups) into a permanent annual part of each NFL team's schedule.

After taking the city of Kairouan and overthrowing the Aghlabids in 909, the Mahdi Ubayd Allah declared himself caliph, which represented a direct challenge to the Umayyad's own claim to the caliphate.  The Fatimids gained overlordship over the Idrisids, then launched a conquest of the Maghreb.  To counter the threat, the Umayyads crossed the straits to take over Ceuta in 931, and actively formed alliances with Berber confederacies such as the Zanata and the Awraba.  Rather than fighting each other directly, the competition of Fatimids and Umayyads played out as a competition for Berber allegiances.  In turn, this provided a motivation for the further Islamic conversion of Berbers, many of whom, particularly farther south away from the Mediterranean, were still Christian and pagan.  In turn, this would contribute to the development of Almoravids and Almohads, which would have a major impact on al-Andalus and contribute to the end of the Umayyad caliphate."},{"text":"The third caliph, Uthman, was from the Umayyad family.

The representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Al-Zubayr, while the representatives of the contingent from Basra waited on Talhah, and offered them their allegiance as the next Caliph, which were both turned down.  In proposing alternatives to Uthman as Caliph, the rebels neutralized the bulk of public opinion in Medina and Uthman's faction could no longer offer a united front.

The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost.

He devoted a whole chapter in his book \"The Measurement of Adult Intelligence\" to the topic of IQ classification and proposed different category names from those used by Lewis Terman.

As Terman's test was published, there was great concern in the United States about the abilities and skills of recent immigrants.  Different immigrant nationalities were sometimes thought to belong to different races, such as Slavs.  A different set of tests developed by Robert Yerkes were used to evaluate draftees for World War I, and researchers found that people from southern and eastern Europe scored lower than native-born Americans, that Americans from northern states had higher scores than Americans from southern states, and that black Americans scored lower than white Americans.  The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the New York patrician and conservationist Madison Grant, who considered the Nordic race to be superior, but under threat of immigration by inferior breeds.

Terman differed from Binet in reporting scores on his test in the form of intelligence quotient (\"mental age\" divided by chronological age) scores after the 1912 suggestion of German psychologist William Stern.  Terman chose the category names for score levels on the Stanford–Binet test.  When he first chose classification for score levels, he relied partly on the usage of earlier authors who wrote, before the existence of IQ tests, on topics such as individuals unable to care for themselves in independent adult life.

Lead can creep at room temperature and tungsten requires a temperature in the thousands of degrees before creep deformation can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0 °C (32 °F).  As a general guideline, the effects of creep deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point for metals and at 45% of melting point for ceramics.  Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature.  Since the creep minimum temperature is related to the melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials.  Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes.  Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice."},{"text":"Aluminum can be brazed or soldered to almost any material including concrete, ceramics, or wood.  Brazing and soldering can be applied manually or through an automated technique.  Manual aluminum brazing can be difficult due to no observable color change before melting.  Similar to other techniques, aluminum's strong oxide can prevent proper bonding.  Strong acids and bases can be used to weaken the oxide or aggressive fluxes may be used.  Brazing alloys for aluminum must have a relatively low melting temperature which is below aluminum's melting temperature (660 °C).  In addition, aluminum alloys with high magnesium content can \"poison\" fluxes and depress the melting temperature which can result in a weak joint.  In some cases, the aluminum parts can be clad with a different material and brazed with a more common technique and filler material.  Brazed joints require overlapping of parts.  The amount of overlap can greatly affect the strength of the joint."},{"text":"During the heating phase, the weld region is heated conductively until melted, without substantial displacement of the material.  Pressure is maintained either at a minimum to keep the parts and the hot plate in contact or at zero with a preset displacement.

The viscosity of the melted material can be controlled through the temperature of the hot plate and the heating time.

In 1660, settler Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a Canadian and Huron militia against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion.  In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement.  In 1663, New France finally became more secure when Louis XIV made it a royal province, taking control away from the Company of One Hundred Associates.

Indeed the wind speed can reach , and one can easily guess that the aircraft can be torn into pieces in such conditions.  However, airline transportation aircraft have overflown tornadoes by more than without damage.  The fact that an airliner does not get destroyed can be explained as follows: tornadoes are violent phenomena only close to the ground and become weaker at height.  A glider dared to cross a weak tornado during a soaring contest in Texas in 1967.  The cumulonimbus base was at .  The glider crossed an extremely turbulent zone and ended up in a turbulence-free zone inverted.  The controls were not responding, and the pilot contemplated abandoning the aircraft.  After some time and a big fright, the controls started to respond again, and the pilot was able to continue his flight.  Pilots in the vicinity did not notice anything."},{"text":"The tornado's unusual behavior consisted of these simultaneous occurrences: abrupt changes in direction, rapid enlargement to a width of in diameter in about 30 seconds, swift increase in forward motion from about within a few minutes, multiple vortices within and around, and an expansive translucent outer circulation without a full condensation funnel while being surrounded and obscured by precipitation made it a worst-case scenario for storm chasers.  Several professional and amateur chasers were caught off guard and impacted by the tornado.  Many were located in a region northeast of the tornado, known as the \"bear's cage\".  Chasers can generally get a clear view of the tornado from that area; however, it places them at great risk and with little time to react should the storm take a left turn."},{"text":"Tornadoes create different damage depending on how fast their wind speeds are.  The Fujita Scale classifies a tornado by its wind speeds.  For example, if the tornado's wind speeds are low, then it is classified as a F0 tornado.  If the tornado's wind speeds are about 200 miles per hour or at 200 miles per hour, then it is classified as a F5 tornado.  In the United States, tornadoes have been known to form at high and low intensities.  The probability of a high intensity or violent tornado differs by location across the country.  For example, due to the high frequency of tornadoes in the \"Tornado Alley\" area mentioned before, a more violent tornado would be more likely to form there due to the strength of the thunderstorms produced by the two bordering air masses.  The states with the highest number of F5 and EF5 rated tornadoes since data was available in 1950 are Alabama and Oklahoma, each with seven tornadoes.  Iowa, Kansas, and Texas each are tied for second most with six.  The state with the highest number of F5 and EF5 tornadoes per square mile, however, was Iowa.  The state with the most number of tornadoes classified as \"violent\", or F4 and F5, is Kentucky, and the state with the highest average intensity ranking for tornadoes is Alabama."},{"text":"A tornado is a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour.  Although the weather channel can sometimes attempt to predict when an tornado will hit and where, sometimes they occur with little or no time for a warning to be given.  Generally tornadoes occur near the trailing end of a thunderstorm and can sometimes be seen forming.  It is a common misconception that tornadoes only occur in areas like Tornado Alley, however they have been observed on every continent except Antarctica.  Since Tornadoes have the ability to strike quickly with no warning and cause extreme devastation American universities are learning to be aware of their vulnerability and risk.

Unlike their East German counterparts, U.S. soldiers did not stay for more than 30 days on the border, though they carried out regular patrols around the clock using foot and helicopter patrols.  They also used a variety of technical measures such as ground surveillance radars to monitor Warsaw Pact troop movements across the border.  A rapid reaction force was on constant duty further behind the border to provide backup in an emergency.  The American presence on the border provoked political controversy in Germany.  During the 1960s the state of Hesse refused to grant U.S. forces land rights to its observation points or allow them to install paved access roads, electricity or telephone lines.  It took the view that since there was no legally recognised border, there was no legal reason for their military observation posts to be built along it.  By the 1980s the American border presence had become the target of peace activists, who in 1984 blockaded the U.S. Observation Post Alpha with a human chain.

Some of these ancient \"lunged\" fish were the ancestors of tetrapods.  However, in most recent fish species these organs evolved into the swim bladders, which help control buoyancy.  Having no lung-like organs, modern amphibious fish and many fish in oxygen-poor water use other methods such as their gills or their skin to breathe air.  Amphibious fish may also have eyes adapted to allow them to see clearly in air, despite the refractive index differences between air and water."},{"text":"The slender lungfish is a freshwater fish and it largely inhabits the middle and lower Congo River basin.  It is a primarily demersal fish, dwelling in the riverbeds of the above basins and in Stanley Pool.  During spawning season, females can be found in open water."},{"text":"The African lungfish is an example of how the evolutionary transition from breathing water to breathing air can happen.  Lungfish are periodically exposed to water with low oxygen content or situations in which their aquatic environment dries up.  Their adaptation for dealing with these conditions is an outpocketing of the gut, related to the swim bladder of other fishes, that serves as a lung.  The lung contains many thin-walled blood vessels, so blood flowing through those vessels can pick up oxygen from air gulped into the lung."},{"text":"Of extant lungfish, only the Australian lungfish can respire through its gills.  In other species, the gills are too atrophied to allow for adequate gas exchange.  When a lungfish is obtaining oxygen from its gills, its circulatory system is configured similarly to the common fish.  The spiral valve of the conus arteriosus is open, the bypass arterioles of the third and fourth gill arches (which do not actually have gills) are shut, the second, fifth and sixth gill arch arterioles are open, the ductus arteriosus branching off the sixth arteriole is open, and the pulmonary arteries are closed.  As the water passes through the gills, the lungfish uses a buccal pump.  Flow through the mouth and gills is unidirectional.  Blood flow through the secondary lamellae is countercurrent to the water, maintaining a more constant concentration gradient."},{"text":"The Queensland lungfish has very complex courtship behavior made up of three distinct phases.  The first is the searching phase, when the fish will range over a large area, possibly searching for potential spawning sites.  A pair of fish will perform circling movements at the surface of the water close to beds of aquatic plants.  They breathe air more frequently and more noisily than normal, possibly reflecting a greater physiological requirement for oxygen.  Individual fish have been observed to breathe air at regular intervals of about 20 minutes, with air breathing accompanied by a distinct loud burp made in the air.  The noisy breathing may be a form of a mating call.  The lungfish seem to do their noisy breathing in concert, even responding to each other, but never in close vicinity of where the eggs are laid."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"Yes, some lungfish are freshwater fish, such as the slender lungfish, which inhabits the middle and lower Congo River basin.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Not Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported","Not Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Adds context to the answer","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Nuance shift","Other","Other","Direct paraphrase","Adds new information"],"comments":["The answer adds 'some' , implying that there are saltwater lungfish, which have not been mentioned in the passages.","","The sentence correctly paraphrases the information in 2.1 but includes the number 1:, therefore is supported at node 9.

While the Geneva Bible was the preferred Bible of Anglican and Puritan Protestants during the Elizabethan Age, King James I disliked the Geneva Bible and made his views clearly known at the conference: \"I think that of all [English Bibles], that of Geneva is the worst.\"  Apparently, his distaste for the Geneva Bible was not necessarily caused just by the translation of the text into English, but mostly the annotations in the margins.  He felt strongly many of the annotations were \"very partial, untrue, seditious, and savoring too much of dangerous and traitorous conceits...\"  In all likelihood, he saw the Geneva's interpretations of biblical passages as anti-clerical \"republicanism\", which could imply church hierarchy was unnecessary.  Other passages appeared particularly seditious: notably references to monarchs as \"tyrants\".\n It followed that the need for a king as head of church and state could be questioned also.  James had been dealing with similar issues with the Presbyterian-Calvinist religious leaders back in Scotland, and he wanted none of the same controversies in England.  Also, if annotations were in print, readers might believe these interpretations correct and fixed, making it more difficult to change his subjects' minds about the meanings of particular passages.\n So when towards the end of the conference two Puritans suggested that a new translation of the Bible be produced to unify better the Anglican Church in England and Scotland, James embraced the idea.  He could not only be rid of those inconvenient annotations, but he could have greater influence on the translation of the Bible as a whole.  He commissioned and chartered a new translation of the Bible which would eventually become the most famous version of the Bible in the history of the English language.  Originally known as the \"Authorized Version\" to be read in churches, the new Bible would come to bear his name as the so-called King James Bible or King James Version (KJV).  The first and early editions of the King James Bible from 1611 and the first few decades thereafter lack annotations, unlike nearly all editions of the Geneva Bible up until that time.  Initially, the King James Version did not sell well and competed with the Geneva Bible.  Shortly after the first edition of the KJV, King James banned the printing of new editions of the Geneva Bible to further entrench his version.  However, Robert Barker continued to print Geneva Bibles even after the ban, placing the erroneous date 1599 on new copies of Genevas which were actually printed circa 1616 to 1625.\n Despite popular misconception, the Puritan Separatists or Pilgrim Fathers aboard the \"Mayflower\" in 1620 brought to North America copies of the Geneva Bible.Text"},{"text":"In 1611 the King James or Authorized version of the English Bible, begun in 1604, was published.

Since \"P. ramorum’s\" discovery, researchers have been working on the development of early detection methods on scales ranging from diagnosis in individual infected plants to landscape-level detection efforts involving large numbers of people."},{"text":"Species of \"Phytophthora\" have been shown to have evolved by the interspecific hybridization of two different species from the genus.  When a species is introduced into a new environment, it causes episodic selection.  The invading species is exposed to other resident taxa, and hybridization may occur to produce a new species.  If these hybrids are successful, they may outcompete their parent species.  Thus, \"P, ramorum\" is possibly a hybrid between two species.  Its unique morphology does support this.  Also, three sequences studied to establish the phylogeny of \"Phytophthora\": ITS, cox II and nad 5, were identical, supporting \"P. ramorum\" having recently evolved."},{"text":"Detection of \"P. ramorum\" in watercourses has emerged as the earliest of early detection methods.

If plants in the watershed are infected with \"P. ramorum\", zoospores of the pathogen (as well as other \"Phytophthora\" spp.) are likely present in adjacent waterways.  Under conducive weather conditions, the zoospores are attracted to the baits and infect them, causing lesions that can be isolated to culture the pathogen or analyzed via PCR assay.  This method has detected \"P. ramorum\" at scales ranging from small, intermittent seasonal drainages to the Garcia, Chetco, and South Fork Eel Rivers in California and Oregon (144, 352, and 689 mi2 drainage areas, respectively).  It can detect the existence of infected plants in watersheds before any mortality from the infections becomes evident.

A tentative agreement between the United States and North Vietnam was reached in late October 1972, but President Thiệu rejected the accord and demanded 69 changes.  Concerned that the Hanoi government might pull out of the negotiations altogether and seek to defeat the South Vietnamese, President Nixon ordered the heavy aerial bombing (Operation Linebacker II) of North Vietnam in December 1972.  Although American losses were light overall and damage in North Vietnam heavy, American public opinion and Congressional anger ran high against the bombing campaign.  The Hanoi government agreed to return to the bargaining table, and Nixon suspended operations against North Vietnam on December 29, 1972.  Nixon offered repeated, private assurances (which did not have the weight of formal diplomatic guarantees) to President Thiệu several times during the first two weeks of January, but could not get him to agree to sign the peace document.  When President Thiệu continued to balk, Nixon told him that he would independently sign the peace accord on January 23 with or without South Vietnamese consent.  Thiệu capitulated.

In January 1968, Vietcong troops launched a surprise attack in South Vietnam, known as the Tet Offensive; one of the points of attack was the U.S. embassy at Saigon.  Though U.S. troops were able to fend off the Vietcong and ultimately prevailed militarily, this attack signaled a turning point in both U.S. troop morale and in public trust of the government's reports on the progress of the war, as many Americans had no idea that the Vietcong were capable of infiltrating American and South Vietnamese headquarters the way that they did.

This was the first such visit in 30 years.  Although the visit mostly went well, a few embarrassing events occurred such as the White House's official website (www.whitehouse.gov) accidentally depicting the flag of South Vietnam in its official announcement of the visit.

However, Watergate resulted in significant Democrat gains in the 1974 midterm elections and when the new 94th Congress convened the following January, it immediately voted to terminate all aid to South Vietnam in addition to passing a bill forbidding all further US military intervention in Southeast Asia.  President Ford was against this, but as Congress had a veto-proof majority, he was forced to accept.  South Vietnam rapidly collapsed as the North invaded it in force, and Saigon fell to the NVA on April 30, 1975.  Later nearly one million Vietnamese managed to flee to the U.S. as refugees.

It was intermittently under consideration, as permitted by Poland's intrusive neighbors, during the period of government reforms, beginning with the Convocation Sejm of 1764.  The Permanent Council was actually created in 1775 by the Partition Sejm, when Empress Catherine the Great of Russia and her ambassador to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, became convinced that it was a way of securing the Empire's influence over the internal politics of Poland (control over the \"Sejm\" and the King).  The Council had remained in continuous operation and was therefore largely immune from szlachta's \"liberum veto\" obstructionism, which could be pursued only during the sessions of the \"Sejm\".  The Council was also much less prone than the \"Sejm\" to other distractions from minor gentry.  Empress Catherine and Ambassador Stackelberg believed that the Council would be dominated by anti-royal magnates and that it would put an end to the King's push toward reforms."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"The Great Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established between 1788 and 1792.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Supported","Supported","Not Supported","Supported","Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Adds context to the answer","Adds context to the answer","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Other","Other","Mis-referencing","Direct paraphrase","Logical conclusion"],"comments":["The answer has been derived from the passages.","","The question is flawed because it asks when the 'Great Sejm' was established, which is a period of time (per 3.1 1788-92).

The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells.  This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells.  The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer.  Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker.  The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989.  Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T-cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system.  The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases.  Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.

He based his experiment on the fact that sending an electric current through water splits the water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen.  So, Grove tried reversing the reaction—combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water.  Eventually the term \"fuel cell\" was coined in 1889 by Ludwig Mond and Charles Langer, who attempted to build the first practical device using air and industrial coal gas.  He also introduced a powerful battery at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839.  Grove's first cell consisted of zinc in diluted sulfuric acid and platinum in concentrated nitric acid, separated by a porous pot.  The cell was able to generate about 12 amperes of current at about 1.8 volts.  This cell had nearly double the voltage of the first Daniell cell.  Grove's nitric acid cell was the favourite battery of the early American telegraph (1840–1860), because it offered strong current output."},{"text":"In neuroscience, Golgi cells are inhibitory interneurons found within the granular layer of the cerebellum.

In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee.  Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction).  Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached.  For an organization to take full advantage of Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding.  While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.\n Frederick Herzberg also came up with the concept of job enrichment, which expands jobs to give employees a greater role in planning, performing, and evaluating their work, thus providing the chance to satisfy their motivators needs.  Some suggested ways would be to remove some management control, provide regular and continuously feedback.

It will also take squid and offal.  The blue-footed booby hunts by diving into the ocean after prey, sometimes from a great height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey.  It can hunt singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks.  Boobies travel in parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish.  When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it will signal to the rest of the group and they will all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows."},{"text":"The natural breeding habitats of the blue-footed booby are the tropical and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean.  It can be found from the Gulf of California down along the western coasts of Central and South America down to Peru.  Approximately one half of all breeding pairs nest on the Galápagos Islands.  Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming underwater in search of its prey.  It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in groups.\n The blue-footed booby usually lays one to three eggs at a time.  The species practices asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together.  This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity.  This makes the blue-footed booby an important model for studying parent–offspring conflict and sibling rivalry."},{"text":"The blue-footed booby (\"Sula nebouxii\") is a marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean.  It is one of six species of the genus \"Sula\" – known as boobies.  It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a sexually selected trait.  Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female.  The female is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to long with a wingspan of up to ."},{"text":"However, booby parents may not be as indifferent as they seem.  Experimental evidence suggests that the parental behavior described above may be masking parent-offspring conflict.  It was discovered that blue-footed booby parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of the younger chick by the older sibling.  This is in direct contrast to the masked booby, a species in which siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject younger chicks from their flat nests.  When blue-footed booby nests were experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original steepness.  In another experiment, blue-footed booby chicks that were placed in masked booby nests were more likely to engage in siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide.  Parents also appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body conditions during periods of food deprivation.  Egg-mass analysis shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season, the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first.  Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into the second egg.  Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that there appears to be no parental favoritism in regards to androgen allocation.  It is important to note, however, that this may simply be that the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output.  Experiments show that what may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict."},{"text":"Since the blue-footed booby preys on fish by diving headlong into the water, its nostrils are permanently closed, and it has to breathe through the corners of its mouth.  Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine.  Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females.

Rothbard says that despite the central bank's policies, \"total bank reserves only rose by $212 million, while the total money supply fell by $3 billion\".  The reason for this, he argues, is that the American populace lost faith in the banking system and began hoarding more cash, a factor very much beyond the control of the Central Bank.

The triode was a three terminal device with a control grid that can modulate the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate.  The triode vacuum amplifier was used to make the first AM radio.  Early audio power amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes and some of these achieved notably high audio quality (e.g., the Williamson amplifier of 1947-9).  Audio power amplifiers based on transistors became practical with the wide availability of inexpensive transistors in the late 1960s.  Since the 1970s, most modern audio amplifiers are based on solid state devices (transistors such as BJTs, FETs and MOSFETs).  Transistor-based amplifiers are lighter in weight, more reliable and require less maintenance than tube amplifiers.  In the 2010s, there are still audio enthusiasts, musicians (particularly electric guitarists, electric bassists, Hammond organ players and Fender Rhodes electric piano players, among others), audio engineers and music producers who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and what is perceived as a \"warmer\" tube sound.\n Key design parameters for audio power amplifiers are frequency response, gain, noise, and distortion.

Magnetic tape provided another dramatic leap in audio fidelity — indeed, Allied observers first became aware of the existence of the new technology because they noticed that the audio quality of obviously pre-recorded programs was practically indistinguishable from live broadcasts.  From 1950 onwards, magnetic tape quickly became the standard medium of audio master recording in the radio and music industries, and led to the development of the first hi-fi stereo recordings for the domestic market, the development of multi-track tape recording for music, and the demise of the disc as the primary mastering medium for sound.  Magnetic tape also brought about a radical reshaping of the recording process — it made possible recordings of far longer duration and much higher fidelity than ever before, and it offered recording engineers the same exceptional plasticity that film gave to cinema editors — sounds captured on tape could now easily be manipulated sonically, edited, and combined in ways that were simply impossible with disc recordings.  These experiments reached an early peak in the 1950s with the recordings of Les Paul and Mary Ford, who pioneered the use of tape editing and \"multi-tracking\" to create large 'virtual' ensembles of voices and instruments, constructed entirely from multiple taped recordings of their own voices and instruments.  Magnetic tape fueled a rapid and radical expansion in the sophistication of popular music and other genres, allowing composers, producers, engineers and performers to realize previously unattainable levels of complexity.  Other concurrent advances in audio technology led to the introduction of a range of new consumer audio formats and devices, on both disc and tape, including the development full-frequency-range disc reproduction, the change from shellac to polyvinyl plastic for disc manufacture, the invention of the 33rpm, 12-inch long-playing (LP) disc and the 45rpm 7-inch \"single\", the introduction of domestic and professional portable tape recorders (which enabled high-fidelity recordings of live performances), the popular 4-track cartridge and compact cassette formats, and even the world's first \"sampling keyboards\" - the pioneering tape-based keyboard instrument the Chamberlin, and its more famous successor, the Mellotron."},{"text":"Magnetic storage in the form of wire recording—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of \"Electrical World\".

Pyramids were reserved for royalty, and were accompanied by large mortuary temples sitting at their base.  Middle Kingdom pharaohs continued to build pyramids, but the popularity of mastabas waned.  Increasingly, commoners with sufficient means were buried in rock-cut tombs with separate mortuary chapels nearby, an approach which was less vulnerable to tomb robbery.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is manifested by serious hepatic, neurologic or psychiatric symptoms.  The disease is fatal if left undiagnosed and untreated.  It is estimated that approximately 1 individual in every 30,000 worldwide have Wilson's disease, corresponding to approximately 15,000 individuals in the European Union and approximately 11,000 in the United States."},{"text":"Left untreated, Wilson's disease tends to become progressively worse and is eventually fatal.  With early detection and treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives.  Liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent."},{"text":"Viliuisk Encephalomyelitis (VE) is a fatal progressive neurological disorder found only in the Sakha (Iakut\/Yakut) population of central Siberia.  About 15 new cases are reported each year.  VE is a very rare disease and little research has been conducted.  The causative agents, origin of the disease, and involved candidate genes are currently unknown, but much research has been done in pursuit of the answers.\n Those inflicted with the disease survive for a period of only a few months to several years.  VE follows three main courses of infection: an acute form, a sub-acute form subsiding into a progressive form, and a chronic form.  Initially, the infected patients experience symptoms such as: severe headaches, delirium, lethargy, meningism, bradykinesia, and incoordination.  A small percentage of patients die during the acute phase as result of a severe coma.  In all cases the disease is fatal."},{"text":"Serum copper is low, which may seem paradoxical given that Wilson's disease is a disease of copper excess.  However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease.  Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner.  Levels above 100 μg\/24h (1.6 μmol\/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg\/24h (0.6 μmol\/24h) are strongly indicative.  High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel)."},{"text":"Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up in the body.  Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver.  Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin, and itchiness.  Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.\n Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (\"ATP7B\") gene.  For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent.  Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy.  Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.\n Wilson's disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication.  Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware.  Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements.  Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems.  A liver transplant may be helpful in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.\n Wilson's disease occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people.  Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 35 years and males and females are equally affected.  It was first described in 1854 by Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after Samuel Wilson."}],"answer":[{"sentence":"Yes, Wilson's disease is fatal if left undiagnosed and untreated.","sentence_id":0,"factuality":["Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported","Supported"],"relevance":["Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question","Directly answers the question"],"fine_grained_factuality":["Other","Logical conclusion","Logical conclusion","Direct paraphrase","Logical conclusion"],"comments":["The answer is derived directly from the context passages.","","The sentence summarises the information in 1.3 and 1.2 (which confirms that 'This disease' in 1.3 refers to 'Wilson's disease'.","","Summarises 2 passages."]}]}

DNA analysis published in 2005 confirmed and clarified cladistic analysis in showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of modern cats and are not closely related to any living feline species."},{"text":"Modern cats, and presumably the basal genera of all cats, such as \"Pseudaelurus\" and \"Proailurus\", use the throat clamp as a common method of dispatching prey.  The suffocation would inhibit sound from the panicked prey, a method used by modern cheetahs and leopards.  The wound from the canines and the lack of air would then kill the prey animal."},{"text":"Broken teeth indicate the frequency at which teeth contact bone.  Increased teeth-bone contact suggests either increased consumption of carcasses, rapid consumption of prey, or increased aggression over kills – all three of which point to decreased prey availability, heightening competition between predators.  Such a competitive environment would favor the faster killing of prey, because if prey is taken away before consumption (such as by out-competing) the energetic cost of capturing that prey is not reimbursed, and, if this occurs often enough in the lifetime of a predator, death by exhaustion or starvation would result.  The earliest adaptations improving the speed at which prey was killed are present in the skull and mandible of \"P. ogygia\" and of \"M. aphanistus\", and in the cervical vertebrae and forelimb of \"P. ogygia\".  They provide further morphological evidence for the importance of speed in the evolution of the saber-toothed phenotype."},{"text":"The general bite-and-retreat hypothesis has been criticised because of its bloodiness and because the struggling prey would have attracted any predators and scavengers in the area.
